# Image classification


### Summary

This is a project on the use of transfer learning and the Keras suite of functions such as ImageDataGenerator with flow_from_directory to extract flower images from folders for classification.

Various callbacks were also used during the model training, such as EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint and LearningRateScheduler.
